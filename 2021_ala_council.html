<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as ,
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (I used
    http://xmlgrid.net/csvToHtml.html)
  * Copy-paste this into a following-year file
  * Replace the table in the following-year file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are
    used in the ethnic caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace '&'to '&amp;' (and then fix the && in the Javascript, and this
    line)
  * Search/replace <tr> with <tr class="initial-show"> (except in this line,
    and in the first row of the table, which should have
    <tr class="header-row">).
  * Add class="table table-striped" to the table as a whole.
  * Format the header row, per last year.
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular,
    the nth-child selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering.
    (Protip: the nth-child selector is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Update the voting button if needed.
  * Update the page title and the jumbotron to reflect the current year.
  * Check to see if multiple division affiliations are split on commas or
    something else.
  * Don't worry about the list of states - it autopopulates.

  <td>My major accomplishments center around laying strong foundations that can be later built on and further improved upon as well as creating expansive outreach projects.  While at the Brooklyn Historical Society, I built a public services program, creating policies and workflows that ensured sustainable management and growth and resulted in expanded hours to the public, shortened response times of remote reference questions, and established a teaching program.  While at the Burke Library, I created an outreach project, #LoveInAction, that engaged both students and alumni/ae. Which included student-curated exhibits and programming that brought current students together with alumni/ae to critically engage with Union’s rich activist history.  At RBSCP, I laid the foundations for building a new collection area that documents social justice and human rights in Rochester. Combining public history with archival theory, I worked, and continue to work, collaboratively with the head of that department to develop and implement a thoughtful and intentional approach to how RBSCP &amp;amp; RIT partners with communities to begin to collect in these important and sensitive subject areas.</td>

  <td>I have been a member of ALA since becoming a librarian fifteen years ago. I immediately became involved with RBMS/ACRL and have been an active member and leader of several committees.  I feel like it is time for me to get more involved with the bigger picture of the work that ALA is doing. While I was a co-chair of an ALA level committee, I never felt connected with what was going on at the ALA level.  Now that I have finished up my term on RBMS' Executive Committee I would like to become more involved with ALA.  ALA is at a pivotal moment, with my experience and connections with the RBMS community, I feel I would be able to provide connection between the two communities to perhaps build strong collaborative bonds, or at the very least, more awareness of how RBMS fits into the larger picture.</td>

  <td>As a public librarian with over a decade in service to small and rural libraries, I am particularly interested in representing the interests of the numerous small libraries across the country which provide a variety of essential services to their local communities. Additionally, my work focuses on helping provide library services to marginalized populations including the geographically isolated, the unemployed or underemployed, people who have developmental or learning disabilities, people living in institutionalized settings, members of ethnic or minority groups in need of specialized services, people who are educationally disadvantaged, older adults, and people who are blind or have physical or mental disabilities. I hope to use a position in the American Library Association Council to assist in providing equitable library access and services to traditionally underserved groups and to the libraries and library staff who make this possible</td>

  <td>I served as a major contributor to the construction of two new libraries from initial planning to opening day. I was involved from the design phase, through the Blueprint phase all the way to constructional design and equipment ordering.

I also worked on the restructuring and recovery of three libraries in St. Croix, USVI after two Category 5 Hurricanes.  This included reconfiguring IT systems, building infrastructure, material handling, and reviving Bookmobile service.

In every place I have been employed, I have been instrumental in improving services from technical outreach to severely lacking internal personnel policy and procedures.  This includes the creation of non-existent policies, creating an extensive new and implemented list of procedures, updated employee policy manuals, safety guidelines, and our new COVID 19 Procedures.</td>

  <td>It has evolved quickly - the need for libraries to quickly evolve from their traditional focuses to something more in keeping with the rapidly expanding online access brought by home internet and other online access. We have succeeded in many ways with new programming, STEM activities, virtual programming, 3D printers, etc. However, we find ourselves thrust once again into a new dawn. Covid 19, as well as the call for diversity and equality, have propelled us to confront several immediate concerns. Librarians are inventive problem solvers. Working together we can create ideas and solutions to continue to offer traditional serves, embrace emerging services, and inspire new and yet unknown services and benefits. In short, my professional mission is to focus on the community I serve, identifying and meeting their current needs, while also inspiring them to view and utilize the library in new and important ways.</td>

  <td>I have been a member of ALA since I started Library School in 1985. Over the years, I have been active in a variety of committees and positions within the organization, including ALA Council. I have also been involved with REFORMA, the National Association for the Promotion of Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking. I am seeking office as an ALA Councilor again because I love my chosen profession and its mission, to promote literacy and lifelong learning and freedom of expression. We are, as a nation, facing great challenges, and it is more important than ever that we preserve people’s right to free expression and access to free reading materials. I think it is also important that we continue to promote equity, diversity, and justice as library professionals. As an ALA Councilor I will do my best to support our values and promote lifelong learning.</td>

  <td>My greatest professional accomplishment has been motivating libraries across the country to install screen readers on to their libraries’ computers for the purpose of being more accessible to patrons with visual disabilities. After noticing the lack of information about different types of screen readers and accessibility aids, I created a presentation to help people learn more about these technologies. I gave my first poster presentation at the Illinois Library Association conference in 2018. Then I spoke at the Nevada Library Association conference on the same subject. I have also spoken at the Library Information Technology Association (LITA) Forum and was asked to do a webinar for them as well. One of the most rewarding speaking opportunities was for a local organization called the Area Training for Librarians &amp;amp; Staff Multi-library In-Service (ATLAS), it consisted of 29 different libraries and had over 400 people in attendance. Almost all libraries in ATLAS now have some kind of screen reader software available at their libraries. I also had the opportunity to speak at the 2019 ALA annual conference.</td>

  <td>There is a dramatic shift happening in our association, with many proposed changes from SCOE coming to a head, as well as many divisions that have been around for decades consolidating or dissolving. As an organization, we have had to be adaptable in the past and that will only become more important moving forward. I am proud to be a member of ALA and I think that with innovation and membership engagement we can transform into an even greater organization.

The structure of ALA is at a crossroads and with current events impacting our lives and libraries, we need to evolve. I am excited for the work that the Forward Together Working Groups are engaged in and I hope that those recommendations will impact ALA to become more transparent, equitable, diverse, and inclusionary. If elected to council, I will facilitate the necessary changes for a sustainable future for ALA.

  <td>I believe that libraries (public, school, academic, and specialized) are a cornerstone to the American democratic society. They support our society’s core value of creating an informed citizenship to help not only with the government and representation of our citizens, but the pursuit of a meaningful life, a life of protected liberties, and a life where the pursuit of happiness is encouraged. At the heart of my library philosophy is the concept of intellectual freedom.  A society is transformed when users have unfettered access to information from multiple sources and multiple points of view. I am proud to be an American, I am even proud to be an educator, and most importantly, I am honored to be an American librarian and an active member of my profession.</td>

  <td>I am the Library Director at Cedar Crest College. I have an MLIS and PhD from Rutgers School of Communication, Information and Library Studies and 15+ years of experience in public and academic libraries and higher education. As a Spectrum Scholar, I benefitted significantly from the support of ALA and I am running to serve as a Councilor-at-Large to help extend the type of opportunities I have had to others. Libraries have an obligation to promote social and racial justice and If elected I will use my wide-ranging skill-set to help amplify the voices of BIPOC and to push libraries and librarians to assume responsibility for systemic inequities within the organization and the field.</td>

We also need to partner with other librarians to show the continuum of libraries that make for a strong and literate society.

  <td>Libraries are not about books.  We are about information and knowledge; and how do we share that with our community to build relationships.  I believe that librarianship is built around customer experience, making connections/building relationships, lifelong learning, and sharing stories.  Customer experience is showing genuine respect to all who come through our doors, whether that is staff or community.   Libraries take that experience and build connections and relationships.  Those connections take many forms--between the library and the community; between individual community members; between community members and agencies and organizations; and between community agencies and organizations.  Behind all of these experiences and relationships we promote growth through lifelong learning.  If we do the first three, we help tell our community’s story.  Every decision made should be examined through a lens that asks:
• How does this affect the community?;
• How does this affect the staff?; and
• How does this affect the organization?

  <td>While transitioning from social work for over 16 years into the library field, I noticed there are many similarities yet many differences. I learned of this through graduate school and listening to other cohorts that were having a tough time navigating the steps and the aftermath of working with patrons that needed supplemental support they did not feel trained.  I became aware that librarians were expected to take on social worker duties when they had not been trained in specific skills. One of my goals is to make sure that library staff is trained in trauma-informed care.
Also, while being a library director, I have found that the support for library staff/directors, in general, is lacking.  I hope to create a position within the system where the main focus of this job is to go around to libraries (especially rural) to support the team as a whole.

  <td>I became President of the Louisiana Library Association at a challenging time. We started transitioning to a new management team at the start of my year, and we successfully untangled numerous financial issues.  We managed to make some important changes within the organization, including updating our bylaws, and we even organized our annual conference ahead of time.  Unfortunately, we then had to make the disappointing but necessary decision to cancel our conference due to COVID-19.  My greatest achievement this year would have to be leading the board to issue a statement on racism.  As a result of my leadership, we were the first state association in the south to issue such a statement.  We have also begun the long process of increasing our diversity within the organization and ensuring that we serve all of our Louisiana library workers.</td>

  <td>I will always be passionate about government information and its accessibility, and I am still very much focused on fake news and its impact on our society, particularly how library workers can address it while keeping our sanity.  However, this pandemic has prompted me to become more public on something that has troubled me privately for years--how to protect and advocate for library workers and libraries, in general.  I have always been passionate about accessibility issues, but now I'm looking more at the issues our staff face when dealing with invisible disabilities.  As someone who faces these challenges in my own personal and professional life, I think it is important to advocate for those who do not have the freedom to do so for themselves.</td>

  <td>I believe that the American Library Association is an important institution in our society.  ALA's advocacy for intellectual freedom, equity of access to information, copyright standards, and media literacy education as well as the services that it provides to its members are vital.  I believe that the Library Ecosystem is important and that every type of library provides unique and necessary services to their patrons.  I also believe in the AASL Vision Statement: "Every school librarian is a leader; every learner has a school librarian."  I also believe that as we move forward we have to work diligently to ensure that ALA and its divisions truly embrace and act on our values of equity, diversity, and inclusion.  As ALA Councilor, I would work to ensure that ALA and its divisions work toward these goals and beliefs.

I gathered a diverse team of librarians, many of whom had not participated in association work previously, to work on this conference and it was extremely successful.  We held the conference in a location where we had not been in 20 years; therefore, the venue was completely new to most of us.  The 3 day conference with an additional day for a pre-conference had over 1000 people in attendance and the revenue from that conference was the highest to date and helped sustain NCLA for the next biennium.

  <td>Libraries and library staff, no matter what type, are at the forefront of bringing information to the public without regard of ability or status while respecting the rights of the individual.  Council is the governing body that ensures our profession remains truthful to our core principles.  In this current era, maintaining our ethics and core principles is more important than ever.  As a Councilor-at-Large, I would aspire to making certain we do not lose sight of what our mission is and work to uphold that mission. Having served as North Carolina Chapter Councilor in the past, I gained a real appreciation of Council and felt fortunate to be a part.

  <td>It is my fervent hope that librarians will soon explore beyond the walls of their institutions and gain viable and quantifiable field knowledge, almost as if we were anthropologists. No matter how often we gauge the usefulness of our libraries by surveys or extract from statistics, it is incumbent upon us to work among our patrons. Too often complacency or eternal administrative tasks stymie the spark that made many librarians join the profession. Librarians often speak about partnering with community bodies, but they are often institutions of similar grade with similar problems. Libraries must break through barriers to ensure that all members of the community are heard, served, and brought under the library's limitless umbrella.</td>

  <td>My professional aspirations and concerns center around the recruitment, retention, and development of library staff. Professional organizations are a crucial tool in that process. How does the profession reach outside its proverbial box to other industries whose skills are compatible and desired in librarianship?  How can ALA assist in that effort through recruitment and marketing tools, training, and development pathways? Additionally, how can ALA remove or mitigate barriers that potential and current members have, such as membership costs, organizational size, structure, and culture? How can ALA assist libraries create a sustainable future for their staff?  I do not purport to have the answers to these questions. But, if selected as councilor-at-large, I hope to be able to work on these areas and create sustainable, inclusive solutions. </td>

  <td>As a child, the library was my favorite after-school hangout. As an adult, I continue to have an ever-present stack of books at my bedside and downloaded to my phone, waiting to take me on my next adventure. And as a parent, I've ensured that my children (now teens thru adults) have grown up with the same attachment to our libraries. Now with my over 30 years of experience collaborating with non-profit organizations in the areas of management, development, finance, and recruitment, I hope to help bridge the gap in library service to historically marginalized or under-represented communities. Wih the role of libraries evolving quickly over the years, I am confident that we will continue to see expansion of the ways that our libraries serve our communities. I hope to have the opportunity to contribute to the visioning and implementation of new and innovative approaches to further knowledge and exploration</td>

  <td>In my work as a librarian, I value social justice praxis, critical pedagogy, and a work environment with a leadership structure grounded in equity.  As an Emerging Leader at Midwinter 2020, I attended multiple council sessions to familiarize myself with ALA's leadership and council structure. I was pleased to see many sessions and ALA members and councilors discussing social justice and equity. However, I was troubled by a lack of transparency within the organization. In order to truly embrace social justice, active dialogue among leadership, council, members, and future members must be encouraged. This means asking hard questions and expecting forthright answers. As a councilor-at-large, I would prioritize empowering council, advocate for the abolishment of barriers that may limit or prevent member participation, and seek to create an environmentally sustainable and more equitable ALA for our must vulnerable libraries and members.

Such as, how do we continue to serve books, resources, and collection materials to people? How will libraries survive during this pandemic?
There is a lot of uncertainty in the world today as we face a myriad of challenges in libraries and fight for justice and equality during this pandemic. Libraries need to think inside the box, but using a different approach. Embraced change and adapt to this new online platform. Focus on providing access to materials in an online environment by digitizing many of the collections. Also, promote the collections and exhibits virtually utilizing all social media outlets. Hosts webinars that feature speakers, authors and collection materials. We want our communities to stay engage and excited about reading and using libraries as a resource.

  <td>I co-founded the International Sustainable Library Development Interest Group in the International Relations Round Table with a mission to raise awareness of and participation in global sustainable library development projects. We have changed the focus of many major international programs at ALA annual to library development issues. As chair of IRRT I worked with all the IRRT committee chairs to implement the 2007-2010 strategic plan by establishing stakeholders, timelines and milestones. We succeeded in implementing several strategic priorities while I was chair. I chaired the International Reception at the Library of Congress that Librarian of Congress hosted for international librarians during ALA Annual in DC in 2010. At the Library of Congress I developed many Cataloger's Desktop online webinars and instructional materials for worldwide users. For the School of Library Science at Catholic University I have taught "Information Literacy and Instructional Design," "Online Information Retrieval" and "Internet Searches and Web Design." As Head of the Near East Section I have led digitization and collection discovery projects</td>

  <td>If elected to council, I would work on ways to implement the full range of ALA strategic priorities especially with regard to diversity and inclusion by establishing stakeholders, timelines and targets with realistic milestones along the way.
As adjunct faculty and area specialist librarian, I am concerned about the scarcity of resources allocated to libraries in communities with underserved populations both here and abroad, especially refugees. If elected to council I would raise awareness of global library development issues both in local communities as well as globally and develop grass roots advocacy strategies to bring pressure to bear on decision makers, as library budgets are under duress.
I am also concerned about ongoing professional development for librarians and opportunities for minority students to enter the profession. I would like to work on reinvigorating Spectrum Scholarship program to increase grants to minority students.

  <td>Fulbright Education Specialist, U.S. State Department, 2019-22.  For the next three years I will be available for countries who need help with projects related to school libraries, instructional technology and information literacy curriculum.  I was inspired to apply for this position because of my previous experience going to Japan in 2005 with a Fulbright grant for educators.

I have received several grants recently.  I used the money to involve students in project-based learning; creating a Roman Garden with 4 Latin classes, 3 Engineering classes built a solar-powered charging station for the library garden area, 3 Art classes created murals.  Each project involved research, planning, presentations, self-evaluation, and amazing final real-world products.

I have received several scholarships recently that I am using to continue my education by earning an E.D.D.

I am National Board Certified Teacher, Library Media PK-12, have also served as an assessor for Pearson, mentored many teachers with the certification and renewal process.

As a member of VAASL, I have been a presenter at many regional and state conferences.

  <td>I have worked my way up from elementary to undergraduate and graduate library instruction.  I have valuable PK-college teaching experience.  I am passionate about libraries and information literacy.  Information literacy is not just important for research and school assignments, but also for life and good citizenship.  As an information literate member of society students and people, in general, should be able to discern the differences in information sources and help prevent the spread of misinformation.  Strong school libraries staffed with librarians with ALA-accredited education are at the fore-front of information literacy instruction.  Along with public libraries and librarians, they are our only hope of a future information literate society.  As an academic librarian, I am connecting library services and resources to curriculum, and teaching concepts in information literacy that lead to civic engagement and academic achievement.</td>

<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as }
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (I used http://xmlgrid.net/csvToHtml.html)
  * Copy-paste this into a following-year file
  * Replace the table in the following-year file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are used in the ethnic
    caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace &; to &amp; (and then fix the && in the Javascript, and this line)
  * Search/replace <tr> with <tr class="initial-show"> (except in this line, and in the first row of the table, which should have <tr class="header=row">)
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular, the nth-child
    selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering. (Protip: the nth-child selector
    is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Update the voting button if needed.

It is equally important to take an active role in contributing to the way we shape the future of our libraries and our association. In doing so we help each other improve and move forward together.

I will continue to work to listen to the members and find ways to make conferences more accessible and help all parts of ALA work together to strengthen everything we do.  Much of the association and how we do things was established in the pre-Internet era. It falls to us to change the way ALA works to use our current capabilities to our advantage. Our customers, our libraries and Librarians are all different while still maintaining a strong emphasis on our core values. ALA maintains our core values and needs to work differently to support our work lives.  Thank you for your vote.</td>

It is through the Council that expressions of membership concerns are most often heard. As members of the ALA Council’s Diversity Caucus, we encourage diversity in the Council’s composition. The issues of intellectual freedom, censorship and social issues are still with us. We must work harder to meet the needs of our constituencies.

We must reinforce our commitment to serve the unserved and underserved.

We must respond to the concerns of minorities within our profession as well as our concern for financial remuneration consistent with the importance of our role in society.

Finally I fully support the efforts of the Association to meet the financial needs of library workers by encouraging the Allied Professional Association to work for better salaries.</td>

For collective learning and collaboration to continue, information should not be restricted to only the elite.

I am proud to have been a researcher for Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries, (ERIAL http://www.erialproject.org/). Among the project goals were understanding how students do research; understanding how relationships between students, faculty and librarians shape the research process; uncovering and addressing students' social and environmental obstacles so that we might develop better user-centered services. ERIAL used an ethnographic methodology, employing close observation of students’ research habits. The work accomplished from this project continues to influence the practices of librarians around the world and has helped us understand our users' needs in astonishing new ways.

Further, my belief is that not only do we all have a duty to serve our professional organizations and I stand ready to do so. I've spent a great deal of time serving on the state level and am ready to take the next step to the national level.

This can be seen in the cutting of school Librarians across major cities in the US. As this trend continues the efforts of ALA to support school librarians and promote the importance and relevance of them in a 21st century education needs to continue. The international nature of our economy and libraries cannot be understated. With the continued expansion of digital information and sharing intellectual property rights, especially across international boundaries, needs continued bolstered protection. ALA also needs to continue its hallmark championing of intellectual freedom and free expression. Our communities still look to our profession for information, education, entertainment and ways to better their lives. I’ll strive to help ALA continue this effort in all libraries for all people.</td>

Too often, our vision is too narrow, imagining the future of libraries as separate from the maldistribution of wealth, regimes of white supremacy and patriarchy, and the impending climate disasters that threaten us all. As one of the only professions grounded in a commitment to collective ownership and shared resources, librarians have both opportunity and responsibility to position ourselves in opposition to capitalist modes of production, distribution, and consumption of knowledge and information. While I have explored these issues in my writing and teaching, in service work at my university and in the profession, serving on Council would give me the opportunity to explore ways of making big change at the institutional and organizational level.

In the world of everything digital, I believe it is important to remember the personal dimension, the human to human connection. Over a person's life course, which is becoming longer and longer, we as librarians have opportunities to do more for and with our customers. As a Councilor-at-Large I will work to cultivate an interest in lifelong learning, in love of inquiry, in libraries, and in stories. Stories can help us make sense of the world and make information more believable. I will aim to support telling "our story" and will work to encourage conversation, asking pertinent questions, listening to answers, and having good follow-up questions.</td>

At the same time, my experiences in libraries have convinced me that organizations cannot continue innovating without closely examining and evaluating legacy services. As much as we wish to do it all, we need to know when to let go of services or programs that no longer serve the needs of our members and communities. This holds as true for #ourALA as it does for our own libraries.

          <td>Libraries continue to face the challenges of dealing with growing transient, homeless and/or mentally ill populations. It's critical that our profession comes to terms with this reality in a positive way: we need to strengthen our partnerships with social service agencies, increase training opportunities for our staff with community colleagues such as mental health professionals and law enforcement, and - most importantly - lobby assertively with our state and national legislators regarding increased funding for mental health services. ALA can assist by increasing targeted webinars, workshops and pre-conferences; provide lobbying assistance and media alerts to members; add the topic to graduate library program curriculums and raise the conversation to a consistent national level. Libraries are community partners in this struggle: not homeless shelters, but compassionate institutions.</td>

          <td>Libraries have a strong, bright future that doesn't look anything like our past! Today and for a strong future, we need to come together, streamline our professional strengths, broaden the diversity within our staff teams and focus on opportunities for ongoing learning and growth. We can only be as effective in service and in advocacy as we are prepared to be. ALA needs to lead the way in focused, productive, accessible and affordable learning opportunities that can be of value to libraries from small, rural communities to major metropolitan areas and everything in between. We talk about helping our customers transform and change with the times? We need to make sure we're doing the same for our libraries. Libraries depend on ALA for so much, but there's so much more we can do. I would be honored to be part of that future.</td>

While all youth issues are important to all ALA divisions, it remains true that representatives from the youth divisions are especially important to bring these issues to the attention of the larger body. It is also important for the youth representatives to take back to their memberships concerns of ALA overall. My experience in AASL, ALSC and YALSA for the last 38 years supports my qualifications. Additionally, it is important for youth librarians to stand with all librarians in discussions of important issues facing the association, and to participate in related decisions to further our collective work supporting the free and equal access to information.</td>

          <td>In today's world, we are faced with many challenges in the library and information science field. One of these challenges is providing all people with skills to harness information making it their own. This process should begin at birth and continue as we journey through life. Students are involved in K-12 education for many years, and should be transformed as learners during those years. However, today we find that many school districts are eliminating school library positions and replacing school librarians with clerks or volunteers. We need to explore various ways to reinstate school librarians so that they can work with the youth of today. Another challenge we face is working in personal silos. As a profession we need to network, collaborate, and support each other regardless of the type of information organization we work for. It is only together that we can fulfill our roles as information professionals.</td>

          <td>Libraries have undergone significant changes in the last few years, shifting from repositories to learning spaces, from places to experiences paving the way for truly transformative thinking and doing. New models are expanding our notions of what it means to create and how these intellectual products are shared and accessed in a digital environment. We must therefore build communities of practice that anticipate future capacity rather than simply improving upon the status quo. In order for these opportunities to materialize at a broad scale, we must foster organizational commitment to change by leveraging shared resources that will empower us to evolve system-level partnerships that drive policy while still enabling individual stories to emerge. I am passionate about getting involved on a national level where we can leverage collaborative resources and partnerships, redefine what it means to provide access to information, and engage our communities across all types of libraries.</td>

It is not enough to give them the resources if we don't provide the education on how to use those tools. School librarians are in an ideal position because they are often leaders in their schools, collaborating with teachers because of the nature of their jobs. They have the opportunity to build relationships with the community outside the school by collaborating with the public library. I have seen the differences in schools with qualified librarians and those without and there is a vast difference in the education the students receive.

Libraries are the only entities that provide equal access information and education to everyone in their communities. Whether that community is a city, school, university, or other organization libraries are vital. Libraries are not a frill but essential to our society. We must expand our visibility and promote what we do in order to demonstrate our importance to all of our stakeholders. The work each of us does is crucial to the success of our libraries. The essence of librarianship is service. I believe service to our profession is equally important as service to library users.

          <td>Two major accomplishments that have had a significant impact on me have been graduating with my MLIS in 2008 and my work from 2012 - 2016 to complete a PhD. After receiving my MLIS, I began to contribute to librarianship through my work as a librarian in a small, rural library system. As a rural librarian, I helped nurture strong relationships within the community, particularly with our local teens. During my doctoral program, I contributed to librarianship thorough publications and research relating to library and information studies. My dissertation focuses on both underresearched rural libraries and empathy as an important aspect of library work. Completing my dissertation, "The Empathetic Librarian: Rural Librarians as a Source of Support for Cyberbullied Rural Young Adults", has been a long but worthwhile journey. A more recent accomplishment is my current position as a Post Doctoral Fellow, which enables me, among other activities, to participate on an IMLS grant that focuses on Makerpaces in rural libraries.</td>

          <td>The image of the American library had been transformed through services such as outreach to the homeless, natural disaster relief, and employment assistance. While librarians have provided these services since the very beginning of libraries, the public is only now recognizing this important “third space”. In this safe haven, patrons with a range of information needs can find solace and compassion. As demand for these social services has increased, there is a greater need for research into how these services are offered and how they can be improved. Librarians are in need of more training on empathy, assistance in accumulating appropriate resources empathetic resources, and support for social justice initiatives. As an ALA council member, I pledge to leverage my experience as an LIS researcher and practitioner to expand the knowledge of these overlooked but critical services.</td>

As Counselor, I will work to balance the needs and ethics of our association with the needs and political realities of our libraries.

While our finances have stabilized from the roller-coaster of the past decade, they are still fragile. ALA must recognize that the organization must develop greater flexibility to allow it to be an organization that can support and be supported by librarians of all types.

As a teenager, I did not envision earning a PhD. After serving in the military, being a teacher, and a librarian (public youth services and K-12), my family encouraged me to go back to school. I have always wanted to have an impact on education. My career has afforded me the opportunity to improve education for our youth, while training the professionals that teach them. Now I am a librarian, educator, and a researcher who uses multiple perspectives to provide empowering knowledge for evidence based practice. I gladly accept my duty to continue to be an advocate for our profession, our youth who need the skills that we teach, and the adults that rely upon the services that we offer.</td>

          <td>I believe that the work of a librarian is a calling that enables one to impact issues affecting the well-being of society. Whether a librarian is a quiet supporter of literacy, an advocate for access to technology, or an outspoken defender of intellectual freedom, their presence reinforces the meaning of democracy. I have always felt privileged to be a librarian and LIS educator. I know the work that I complete every day, makes a difference in society. That is why I believe libraries are educational pillars that require stable funding. If re-elected to the ALA Council, I will continue to advocate for matters that emphasize the importance of libraries in society. I will be a champion for the leadership development of new and experienced librarians, the education of youth, programs that emphasize collaborative activities between various types of librarians to teach information literacy skills, and equal access to information.</td>

My research area examines cultural representation and visual aesthetics found in Chicanx picturebooks to support critical literacy practices in elementary and early literacy education.

As a recipient and active Spectrum member, I champion ALA’s efforts to provide operational support to ensure effective operational structure and Spectrum funding. I would also advocate for inclusive and systemic measures that ALA Council can move forward to ensure access to diverse literature for children and teens. Increasing the number of underrepresented librarians is essential to the sustainability and growth of our profession. Increasing the number of students of color in higher education is another issue that I would strongly advocate for if I had the privilege to serve on ALA Council.</td>

I also have been able to lead our state in creating the discussion that led our state to provide funding for licensed school librarians. Unfortunately, elections matter and this plan was eliminated under our current governor. I have also created relationships with other library groups in our state, so that we can advocate for each other as we can understand all issues that impact libraries.

Through advocacy, I feel that I would give a strong voice not only for school libraries, but the need for relationships between the divisions of our association. As someone that has experience with building relationships with all types of libraries and has worked at the local, state, and national library levels, I feel that I would be a strong candidate for this position.</td>

A few highlights include: as chair of YALSA’s Strategic Planning Committee I helped coordinate the first "Support Teen Literature Day” in Chicago and emceed the media event. I presented on graphic novels twice at Reaching Forward, the Illinois conference for support staff. I had the honor of being on the committee that gave Francesca Lia Block the Edwards Award. I have been a member of two award committees their first year: Great Graphic Novels and Morris. I think local partnerships and involvement are important and I represent the library at various community activities. Through my position I became involved in the Village’s CONECT Committee, the economic development committee, and serve as chairperson. We created the Hanover Park Chamber and I was a founding board member. We recently expanded by merging with our neighboring Chamber and I continue on the Bartlett Area Chamber board as the library's representative.</td>

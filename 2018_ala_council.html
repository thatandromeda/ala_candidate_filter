<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as }
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (I used
    http://xmlgrid.net/csvToHtml.html)
  * Copy-paste this into a following-year file
  * Replace the table in the following-year file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are
    used in the ethnic caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace & to &amp; (and then fix the && in the Javascript, and this
    line)
  * Search/replace <tr> with <tr class="initial-show"> (except in this line,
    and in the first row of the table, which should have
    <tr class="header-row">)
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular,
    the nth-child selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering.
    (Protip: the nth-child selector is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Update the voting button if needed.
  * Update the page title and the jumbotron to reflect the current year.
  * Check to see if multiple division affiliations are split on commas or
    something else.

In my first term as Councilor-at-Large, I advocated for policies that increase equity, diversity, and inclusion and defend intellectual freedom in our work and our communities. I listen carefully to understand the context and complexity of each issue, so that I can make a thoughtful decision that upholds the values of our profession.

If re-elected, I aspire to expand these commitments to advocacy and values-driven decisions by participating in Council committees. My primary interests would be ALA budgets and resolutions. Clearly understanding these essential processes can be the foundation for any member to have an impact in ALA; I hope to help make them more accessible to all.

Serving on Council has taught me how to make a difference in my association. I am seeking a second term so I can pay that valuable lesson forward to others.</td>

Currently, there are very few jobs available for workers without some college education. Libraries offer a second chance to bridge the education gap through programs, readily accessible information, and partnerships with government, local non-profits, Libraries create a demand for higher education, leading to a better-earning workforce, higher profits for business, and potentially, increased funding for libraries.

Ominous developments in the political climate suggest that we need to work harder to prevent the creation of barriers to free access to information, particularly where that access has been funded by public dollars.

Given the increasingly shrill voices in Washington, we need to speak with one voice about the eternal value of libraries, at the federal, state and local levels.</td>

I am committed to fighting for the preservation of these freedoms, as well as the promotion of information literacy and universal access. As a means to this end, I strongly believe in investing in the growth and continuing education of library professionals, the intelligent incorporation and application of new technologies to library service, and encouraging libraries everywhere to adapt to the ever changing needs of the populations they serve.</td>

              <td>I have been involved in various professional associations including DCLA, ASCLA, and IFLA. I led a group of library students as they redesigned DCLA’s website, was a key player during the merger between ASCLA and FAFLRT, authored two passing resolutions with ALA Council, and co-chaired the Conference Accessibility Taskforce. I coordinated a workshop for international librarians to learn about library services to people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, and am currently the Secretary of the Library Services to Persons with Special Needs Standing Committee in IFLA.

As a Library Associate with DCPL I created a curriculum on basic computer use for older adults who lost their eyesight. Since joining the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped at the Library of Congress as a Reference Librarian, I have authored two dozen reference guides for people with disabilities and am a subject matter expert on assistive technology and web accessibility. I have presented on these subjects at ALA and IFLA and have offered four related webinars to librarians and library school students.</td>

              <td>This is a pivotal time for our profession with many challenges and opportunities. Our membership numbers are diminishing every year as we face questions from within about our Association’s value and questions from outside about our profession’s importance.

I still believe we can answer our members’ concerns by fortifying our support for issues that matter most to us such as intellectual freedom, information literacy to combat misinformation, the library as a space for diverse communities and viewpoints, and a free and open internet. I believe ALA has the responsibility to educate a skeptical public about the importance of libraries and we should be creative in our strategies. As Councilor, my goal will be to help guide the Association to continually face these challenges head-on.

As Council that will be my constant platform should I be elected. Thank you for your consideration.</td>

Additionally, I collaborated to develop and produce "Open to All" a toolkit for Libraries serving the GLBT community. I also helped spearhead the development of two new awards (the Newlen-Symons Award for Excellence in Serving the GLBT Community and the GLBTRT Award for Political Activism). I also worked with ALA staff and the ALA President to issue statements regarding discriminatory legislation in Indiana, North Carolina, and Georgia. I was also honored to work with ALA staff to represent the GLBTRT at the memorial for the Pulse nightclub shootings in Orlando. When a book challenge occurred in Hood County, Texas, I represented the GLBTRT in signing a letter supporting the material and urging its retention in the library. I also attended the hearing and gave a statement to the County Commissioners reiterating the importance of intellectual freedom.</td>

              <td>Libraries are under pressure more than ever due to budget cuts and competing finding priorities in states and municipalities. This can be seen in the cutting of school Librarians across major cities in the US. As this trend continues the efforts of ALA to support school librarians and promote the importance and relevance of them in a 21st century education needs to continue. The international nature of our economy and libraries cannot be understated. With the continued expansion of digital information and sharing intellectual property rights, especially across international boundaries, needs continued bolstered protection. ALA also needs to continue its hallmark championing of intellectual freedom and free expression through its continued efforts to develop resources for our members and users to meet those challenged.  Our communities look to our profession for information, education, entertainment and self-improvement. I’ll strive to continue this effort in all libraries for all people.</td>

They are  forums for information and sharing ideas which allow civil discussion, life long learning and provide access to the internet and technology.  Libraries are education, employment, entrepreneurship, empowerment and engagement (ALA Libraries Transform).  Libraries are facing funding and sustainability issues, the ability to keep the access to information open, net neutrality issues, censorship, privacy and intellectual freedom and ethical issues.

ALA must provide leadership and advocate for our nation’s libraries. ALA must work to keep libraries open for all, throughout the United States.  I am proud to be the chair of the ALA Committee on Professional Ethics (COPE), a member of the Freedom to Read Foundation, and continue to work to help rural libraries provide the services their communities need.</td>

I will fight to ensure access for all whenever this right is threatened or limited.

(Lankes) We are living in an ever-changing society where libraries and librarians are more needed than ever. Libraries and librarians provide important services to their communities ranging from readers advisory, making and creating, technology support, reference, and many unique services beyond our traditional library offerings. I firmly believe in our Library Bill of Rights and our duty to protect our members' intellectual freedom and privacy. As a school librarian, I believe in our commitment to educate and engage the ideas and passions of those who we serve. As an ALA Councilor-at-Large, I wish to be in the room where we discuss important policies and make important decisions which affect our profession as a whole.

This should be an overarching goal of ALA that involves every member.  Gaining increased market share and using performance measures that detail organizational results and impact (outcomes) need to be shared. Libraries must be building their capacity, employing new technologies and delivering new products to our customers that are relevant to today's lifestyles. These are critical to all libraries' future. There are plenty of challenges out there for libraries. How we meet them and adapt to our changing world will determine our future!

I'm excited to collect practical strategies that will help new and future academic librarians be successful on the job hunt and in their first jobs.

I co-created a Virginia New Members Round Table in 2011, and served as its Chair from 2011-2013. We've hosted dozens of socials around Virginia and increased the number of new members by several hundred. We created a special program track at our annual state conference, and I have gotten wonderful feedback about how much more fun and meaningful both VLA and the conference are now.

None of my library school’s student association benefits were available to distance students, so I founded a Virginia branch for my classmates and coordinated two find-a-job panels, one of which ended up being the most-attended virtual event in UNT SLIS history. Founding this LISSA branch taught me that even library school students can “make it happen.”</td>

Services for new librarians/association members have been my passion since I joined the profession:  almost the entirety of my professional development work has been devoted to issues concerning new professionals. According to Library Journal, over 5000 students graduate from library school every year, but only a fraction of these join ALA, and those that do join are often confused about what ALA does and aren't aware of the opportunities and services it provides. Continuing to serve as an ALA Councilor-at-Large would give me a platform with which I could both promote the interests of new professionals within the association.

              <td>In today's world, we are faced with many challenges in the library and information field. One of these challenges is providing all people with skills to harness information making it their own. This process should begin at birth and continue as we journey through life. Students are involved in K-12 education for many years, and should be transformed as learners during those years. However, today we find that many school districts are eliminating school library positions and replacing school librarians with clerks or volunteers. We need to explore various ways to reinstate school librarians so that they can work with the youth of today.  Another challenge we face is working in personal silos. As a profession we need to network, collaborate, and support each other regardless of the type of information organization we work for. It is only together that we can fulfill our roles as information professionals.</td>

              <td>In spite of the challenges we face, as a profession, it's an exciting time to be a librarian and an even more exciting time to work in public libraries. Patrons continue to rely on our diverse services and they trust us to provide reliable information. Throughout my 19-year career, I have worked in almost every capacity. I was an integral part in transforming my library’s buildings and service offerings to meet the needs of 21st Century patrons. These transformations have allowed us to successfully met the needs of early technology adopters while balancing the needs of late tech “relinquishers.” I’m optimistic about the profession’s future. If elected, I bring a passion to serve. I’ve always pursued ways to be of service to my library system, my patrons and my staff. I would now like to serve my profession by working alongside fellow councilors to tackle the big issues facing libraries.</td>

I don't want to see ALA go down the way the Canadian Library Association did when it dissolved last year. In order to have a strong ALA, we need a strong Council with strong leaders on board.

At Kansas State University, I developed and implemented an Undergraduate Diversity Internship program to introduce underrepresented undergraduate students to librarianship as a career.

I continue to represent disability librarianship and especially stand up for the rights of current and prospective members within ALA in support of our new strategic direction of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. In addition to immersion in domestic library issues, I am honored to participate in sectors of international librarianship, striving to represent ALA members and policies, sharing ideas across borders.

It is our moral responsibility to guide our patrons toward accessing all types of information and resources and autonomous thinking. When intellectual freedom is jeopardized, when information or resources are withheld, so is a person’s ability to learn and make thorough, thoughtful decisions. All types of libraries within a community are a great strength of a community. A librarian is the cornerstone for developing the most well rounded, literate citizens in a democratic society. We want to grow people who are capable of learning for themselves, thinking for themselves, and communicating their expertise in an effective and productive manner.

If elected to council, I would work on ways to implement the full range of ALA strategic priorities by establishing stakeholders, timelines and targets with realistic milestones.

As an area specialist librarian, I am concerned about the scarcity of resources allocated to libraries in communities with underserved populations both here and abroad, especially refugees. If elected to council I would raise awareness of library development issues both in local communities as well as globally and develop grass roots advocacy strategies to bring pressure to bear on decision makers as library budgets are under duress.

I am also concerned about ongoing professional development for librarians and opportunities for minority students to enter the profession.</td>

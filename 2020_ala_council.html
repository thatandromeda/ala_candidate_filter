<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as }}
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (I used
    http://xmlgrid.net/csvToHtml.html)
  * Copy-paste this into a following-year file
  * Replace the table in the following-year file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are
    used in the ethnic caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace '& 'to '&amp; ' (and then fix the && in the Javascript, and this
    line)
  * Search/replace <tr> with <tr class="initial-show"> (except in this line,
    and in the first row of the table, which should have
    <tr class="header-row">)
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular,
    the nth-child selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering.
    (Protip: the nth-child selector is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Update the voting button if needed.
  * Update the page title and the jumbotron to reflect the current year.
  * Check to see if multiple division affiliations are split on commas or
    something else.
  * Don't worry about the list of states - it autopopulates.

      <td>If elected ALA councilor, I would like to work toward improving the disconnect that librarians of color continue to experience as evidenced by recent conference events.  Librarianship is a great profession employing talented, dedicated, and passionate individuals, but issues of, not just inclusion, but recognition of our various differences and their value continue to challenge our overall ability to attract and retain a genuine representation of who we are.  I was disappointed to read that fear and intimidation were employed to shut down honest discussions.  Librarians have to create safe spaces in which to have difficult conversations.  I would like to be a part of investigating solutions to these professional challenges.

      <td>I am concerned with the future of information access and collective knowledge within our society. Inequitable information access exists and helps to perpetuate economic divides. There are communities that have limited access to the internet and information sources. This limits people’s ability to gain the information they need for lifelong learning and employment opportunities. Libraries are being underfunded there is a problem with the information disparity that exists. Paywall content such as newspapers and academic journals limit access to only the privileged, leaving disadvantaged populations starved for information. For collective learning and collaboration to continue, information should be equally accessible to all. This is a concern for our profession, as we promote learning and free access to information for all people.</td>

      <td>Librarianship is is in a state of constant change, while remaining critical to informing and educating a population awash in misinformation and fake news. Despite these challenges, librarians continue to provide those in need with high-quality and factual information resources, educate and inform them on locating these resources and how to use them, and equip them with the tools necessary to be productive members of society. I strive to live out this philosophy in everything that I do as a librarian, and I welcome to opportunity to continue my service on ALA Council, as I advance these concerns to the highest levels of our profession in a national and international context. I look forward to working with ALA members, and the communities that we serve, to work together to solve the challenges before us.</td>

A national campaign to promote and reintroduce America to all the great services and resources we provide is needed.  We must redouble our efforts to share the great things we do with our users.  We must also passionately lobby for increased funding.  As libraries take on the further trope of social worker by providing free summer meals and administering narcan we should demand more funding.  Along side with these programs, we need to ensure that our mission of providing equitable access to all is keystone and paramount.  We need to provide resources to our elected officials about they why and how we do what we do so they have a fuller understanding that everyone is welcome at the library.

As I have grown older, I have learned that it takes more than just knowledge to succeed professionally – it takes mentoring and support from fellow colleagues, access to opportunities for further development, and a passion to make a difference.  If elected to ALA Council, I would fervently support issues surrounding the advancement of libraries and librarians, equity, diversity and inclusion, information literacy, intellectual freedom, open access, professional development, and U.S. copyright law.  Although these are challenging times, I believe we can make a difference if we work together, support each other, and stand up to the iniquities in our society, our profession and our libraries.</td>

      <td>ALA Council is reviewing changes suggested by SCOE recommendations. A strength of the current Council configuration is the geographic diversity allowed with each state's Chapter Councilor. Geographic diversity in some form must continue - if Council's new committee structure representation evolves into those who live in the most populous parts of the country, Council will ultimately fail.   Transparency and continued dialogue are still needed. My goal is to both help update the Council structure while respecting and defending those elements of current Council structure that work. Democratic representation by library professionals from every state in Council meetings is key to Council's function.  Ultimately, we need to get our Council house in order as efficiently as possible, then focus on why we're in business:  to serve others, advocate for libraries as agents of social change and change lives. </td>

As ALA navigates the streams of change, I want to be a part of helping to chart that course.  One of the major strengths of ALA is that we have a diverse type of libraries and librarians.  We bring unique voices and experiences that when put together can help move ALA forward.

    I have a wide variety of experience that will help me serve librarians from a number of different library types and communities. I started my career as a high school and then middle school librarian, then transitioned to cataloging for a county-wide public library system, worked briefly as a government documents and cataloging librarian for a federal agency, and have now landed squarely in academia, where I work for a very small, private, non-profit, liberal arts / career prep institution in rural Pennsylvania. I have experience in small libraries and large libraries, in technical services and public services, and I have a talent for bridging divides and talking to anyone.</td>

The organization's structure should encourage communication and synergy within all levels and across all membership groups.

I would also like to work with ALA to continue to push our profession beyond the idea of traditional library services.

      <td>Beginning my career as a Children's Librarian at Los Angeles Public Library, I've held progressively responsible positions in public libraries for over 20 years. I am now Assistant Director with Chesapeake Public Library in Virginia. I've served and advocated for customers of all ages, people with disabilities, new Americans, people without homes, and customers from all socio-economic backgrounds. I've worked in diverse communities spanning suburban and urban areas in CA, DC, MD, and VA. I am an avid student of leadership. I completed the PLA Leadership Academy, the ALA Leadership Institute, and attended the ALA-APA Certified Public Administrator's Program. I've written for Public Libraries Online, led webinars and trainings, and presented at local and national conferences. I've been active with ALA's Scholarships &amp; Study Grants Committee, the Century Awards Jury and served on PLA's Conference Planning Subcommittees and PLA Leadership Development Committee. I’ve held leadership roles in the DC, MD, and VA Library Associations. I served as ALA Councilor-at-Large from 2016-2019.  I look forward to serving again beginning in 2021. </td>

We should embrace the move from a locally-centered information universe to one where collections, systems and services based on coordination and collaboration, and located everywhere, feel local and thus increase the effectiveness of library and information services. At scale, all library collections are available, stored and preserved with intentionality towards permanence.

    Equity: Information resources are a common good that are too important to continue to monetize beyond reasonable limits. Winding down Midwinter is a great first step as we think critically and inclusively about our commitment as individuals and as an organization to maximize information access for individuals and institutions regardless of their financial and geographical situation. Firewalls must go, the vendors and need for money cannot continue to drive ALA's direction as we move to a new era of openness and equity for the good of society.</td>

The 3 day conference with an additional day for a pre-conference and had over 1000 people in attendance and the revenue from that conference was the highest to date and helped sustain NCLA for the next biennium.

      <td>This is my swan song, You all must know,
    Like Council, it’s nearly my time to go.
    This year’s ballot is the final for me.
    Whether it’s up or it’s down - we’ll see what we see.

    It’s hard to believe that Council’s been sacked.
    The heart of our democracy, demolished and packed,
    Replaced by a cell unproven but with potential-
    I hope that it has the elements essential.

    If elected, I will never dwell in the past
    But work to infuse the new structure with class
    With vitality, soul, and a certain panache
    And always to serve our members carte blanche.

    To weather the wiggles , to conquer the storm
    To advance our values and say no to the swarm,
    My strength is my love for what libraries do -
    For free speech, service, to IF always true.

    I will work to ensure that schools have a place
    At ALA’s big table there must be a space.
    Our kids are our future, our libraries their fuel
    To win this battle, we will need every tool.</td>

My work prior to these leadership experiences and within the Ethnic Affiliates have positioned me well to see the potential of our association as an advocate and leader for the profession. Only through the hard work and passion of our members can we accomplish these goals by moving our association forward together.

    Over the past 20 years, I have operated a used and antiquarian bookstore, designed and taught gifted education in public schools, managed a restaurant, earned graduate degrees, and have used my knowledge and skills to help people as circulation coordinator in my academic library; I have the privilege of helping others find information.  And, I love sharing and networking within the greater ALA library family.

    Local libraries intend to promote services, education, and preservation within their communities, but local communities cannot shape policies and culture to support the values that sustain libraries as rich resources on their own.  I am interesting in helping libraries retain cultural relevance, envision the future, and grow.</td>

When I started as a private in the military, I never imagined that I would have a career change and become who I am today. I did this with the support of my husband, mother, and children. They helped me to exceed what I thought was going to be my norm. Exceeding that norm is an accomplishment.

    I know that service members have a significant impact on the world. Today, I am pleased that I have transitioned into an educator (higher education &amp; K-12), librarian (public and school), researcher, and author. I continue to serve my community and country by educating our future. I use multiple perspectives to provide empowering knowledge for evidence-based practice. Sometimes people are not able to identify their purpose in life. I know my purpose is to be an advocate for our profession and our youth.

As librarians, we can make an impact on the issues affecting the wellbeing of others by facilitating access to information in various formats. Whether a librarian is a quiet supporter of literacy, an advocate for access to technology, or an outspoken defender of intellectual freedom, their presence reinforces the meaning of democracy. I understand that this profession combats the destructive impact of misinformation, digital and information poverty, and a general lack of access to resources. Libraries are community cornerstones that should be funded and protected. If re-elected to ALA council, I will advocate for matters that relate to the importance of libraries in society. I champion leadership development, the education of youth, equal access to information, and libraries as collaborative community partners. I understand that ALA members need councilors that listen and advocate for their needs.</td>

      <td>Working in libraries the past 6 years has made me think of all the things we bring to the profession. Libraries and librarians are multi-faceted community connectors. I have always worked to support the idea that the library is both a place and also a person-- and that means that each of us working in libraries has the ability to connect our patrons and our community, and bring the library to them. During my current term of Council, I have had the tremendous opportunity to learn so much about what ALA does as an organization, and who works hard to make our philosophies align with our intentions for making libraries and library community diverse, inclusive, and open to all. However, we still have so much work to do. I would love the chance to be part of that future conversation. </td>

The grant helped transform the Federal Depository Library Program including GPO eXchange and the Preservation Stewardship Program. Through private grant resources and a cooperative program the UofSC Libraries has scanned and geo-rectified nearly half of the state's historic aerial photography collection and mad it public accessible. In 1993 I was fortunate to be part of the DuPont Circle Group that planned and held the "Conference on the Future of Government Information" in October 1993. As Chair of Federal Depoitory Library Council, the Council completed a two-year study on steps to a modern FDLP, in the fall of 2007 the Council issued the report "Knowledge Will Forever Govern".

      <td>ALA is in the process of evolving into a 21st century association. Council is transforming after the events of 2019 Midwinter meeting and is becomng a more inclusive body.  I believe that council must consider SCOE’s suggestions and implement those parts which make our association, more transparent, and nimble.  One thing is clear, the association still needs a body, preferably a governing body, that reflect the membership of the association, that can evolve with changing membership interests and priorities. Second, ALA needs to make sure it is financially sound and that includes proper management of the endowment, financial responsibility, inclusiveness in membership dues, and oversight of revenue producing activities including publishing, certification, and professional development.  I believe my 36 years of experience in the profession and over 30 years as an active member of the association provides me the long-term perspective that is needed in this period of transition.</td>

Another component of my portfolio that I would offer in the position is a solid and proven record in collaborative projects and partnerships.

In addition, the demands of providing access to patrons is compounded by limitations that arise when trying to manage additional services without consideration for funding. In these times, I believe that strong association and support is vital in redefining the modern library.  ALA should rely on the strengthen of its membership to launch initiatives that will work to bring a better understanding of the dynamics of information agencies and their needs to those who create policies and funding opportunities, locally and nationally.  If elected, I would use my experience and participation in ALA for over 30 years to help in the effort to identify the important role of today’s libraries in an age of increasing digital reliance and given the evidence of future demands, champion policies that provide for appropriate funding. </td>

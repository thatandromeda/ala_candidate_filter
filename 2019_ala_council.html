<!-- To make this next year:
  * Download candidate spreadsheet
  * Search-replace all commas with an unlikely character, such as }
  * Export to CSV
  * Use a CSV-to-HTML converter to make the table (I used
    http://xmlgrid.net/csvToHtml.html)
  * Copy-paste this into a following-year file
  * Replace the table in the following-year file with your new table
  * Search/replace to be sure that "AILA", "APALA", "BCALA", and "CALA" are
    used in the ethnic caucus columns, not just the fully-spelled-out versions
  * Search/replace the } to turn it back into ,
  * Search/replace & to &amp; (and then fix the && in the Javascript, and this
    line)
  * Search/replace <tr> with <tr class="initial-show"> (except in this line,
    and in the first row of the table, which should have
    <tr class="header-row">)
  * Test to see if it works. Who knows what the data format is. In particular,
    the nth-child selectors are all totally fragile around column reordering.
    (Protip: the nth-child selector is 1-indexed because what is this, Mars?)
  * Update the voting button if needed.
  * Update the page title and the jumbotron to reflect the current year.
  * Check to see if multiple division affiliations are split on commas or
    something else.
  * Don't worry about the list of states - it autopopulates.

My driving force since beginning my career as a librarian has been to connect library services to the unserved and underserved. I am committed to extending the library's reach into the community to continue to enrich the lives of others and I tirelessly research and implement new ideas, programs, and partnerships to keep things fresh, fun, and engaging for our patrons.</td>

These are all great accomplishments in which I cherish, however, none compare to the book club that I began years prior at EPCC. The idea of bringing faculty, students, and staff together for the enjoyment of reading is a huge highlight. There is nothing better than to see the increase in literacy, especially among young students. Today our book club is thriving, we meet once a month and have even included a potluck lunch to go with our event. Students are excited, not only to read but to discuss what they read with fellow students, staff and faculty members. Many of my colleagues have not only sent their students to our book club, but they have also joined our group.</td>

In 2010, I was accepted and there is where I learned about the greatness of ALA. ALA is more than a library organization, it is about education, freedom, and literacy. It is a champion of the basic human need for knowledge. ALA has given me a sense of direction, networking and more importantly a sense of pride in the profession I love. My election to ALA council was an exciting position where serious decisions were made that affected the organization and profession. My past experience in this capacity has prepared me to serve another three years on Council where I can be even more effective. I feel that I can continue the great work I have begun with fellow colleagues and continue moving ALA forward. Once again, I ask for your support!</td>

I will work to help our members understand resolution creation, debate, and outcome.

Midwinter has been a topic of conversation and concern throughout ALA for years.  Virtual work has led to fewer in-person committee meetings at Midwinter.  However, there is value in face-to-face events for professional development and Midwinter.  I support a change in ALA policy to meet our member’s needs by refocusing Midwinter on the events that membership surveys have identified as the reasons people attend conference.

This can be seen in the cutting of school Librarians across major cities in the US. As this trend continues the efforts of ALA to support school librarians and promote the importance and relevance of them in a 21st century education needs to continue. The international nature of our economy and libraries cannot be understated. With the continued expansion of digital information and sharing intellectual property rights, especially across international boundaries, needs continued bolstered protection. ALA also needs to continue its hallmark championing of intellectual freedom and free expression through its continued efforts to develop resources for our members and users to meet those challenged. Our communities look to our profession for information, education, entertainment and self-improvement. I’ll strive to continue this effort in all libraries for all people.</td>

I served as editor of the LITA Blog and am currently a LITA Board Member. I am a reviewer for Library Quarterly and Technology Editor for the Journal of Radical Librarianship.

I am deeply committed to working to improve the association, and I believe that I can leverage the position of Councilor-at-Large to help improve member communications, experiences, and outcomes. As Councilor-at-Large, I would push for more transparent and efficient processes to engage the greater membership in the governance of ALA. Beyond this commitment ensuring member voices are heard, I wholeheartedly believe that ALA needs to contexualize library work as social justice work, and I intend to devote my efforts on Council to advocate for this perspective. Only through such advocacy can we steward and transform ALA to better reflect the realities of library work and support library workers.</td>

I'm running because I want to be a voice for both ALA members and non-members. Decisions made by council often impact all library workers, regardless of their membership status, and I think it is vital to listen to and represent those opinions as well.

We will hire a new Executive Director; we are looking for the best and highest use of our assets, we are entering a period of investment budgeting to situate the Association for a stronger future, we are ramping up our local and national advocacy efforts, and more. At the same time, there are political/cultural divides within our country that challenge our ability to provide community-based, social justice-informed services to all. I would like to be a part of our Association’s efforts to champion intellectual freedom, advocacy, and diversity, and I see my election to Council as the most impactful way to help. My background includes extensive service throughout ALA, and my professional and personal involvement with equity, diversity and inclusion will provide a set of lenses through which to assess and lead organizational change.</td>

Within 5 years, we had outgrown the building and had to expand the library building and incorporate automation into our processes.

In 1995, I went to Sumter County, FL and developed a countywide, collective  library system, including 5 small municipal libraries.

While in the position, I directed the finances and investments of the organization, which included authorizing payments, disbursements, and investments of funds relating to its budgets. More importantly, I streamed-lined the preparation of financial reports and developed policies and procedures for managing organization’s accounts.

Another major accomplishment was my work on ALA’s Task Force on the Context for Future Accreditation. The Task Force researched and developed a white paper for the ALA Executive Board that describes the context and future of accreditation and include recommendations that arise from the research process. I chaired the research subcommittee and participated in developing the findings with other members of the Task Force.  The two-year commitment was a very rewarding experience!

Finally, I believe being a Spectrum Scholar is an additional accomplishment because it comes along with a commitment to give back to the profession. My work in ALA has been an effort to contribute my experience and knowledge to the profession.</td>

I believe the profession needs to focus on preparing librarians with skills, including curriculum design, programmatic assessment, and establishing new standards/criteria for graduating LIS students.

In addition, I am concerned about declining membership in the organization, costs associated with running the organization, including holding conferences, and the direction of ALA as it faces challenges in the current cultural, political, and social environments.

Of course, I would like to contribute to ALA as it refocuses its efforts to address issues, such as Net Neutrality and Fake News.</td>

I think one of the reasons that I got involved was that I believe that you can't sit back and be on the sidelines.  In order to make an impact, you have to be a part of those leading the charge.  You can't always assume someone is going to do it for you.  One of the major strengths of ALA is that we have a diverse type of libraries and librarians.  By uniting together in one organization and valuing each and every type of library, we have the opportunity to be a loud voice.  We all serve the same patrons - albeit at different points in their lives.  It is important that for our entire library ecosystem to sustain itself, we have to all work together for all types of libraries.  I'm looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of the work that helps move us all forward.</td>

As professional librarians, we must continue building programs and services that reflect the diversity in society.

              <td>Professional Concerns:

I just finished my first year term as the Director of Library Services for Santa Margarita Catholic High School. Even though I served as the school's Library Assistant for 7-years before I was promoted to Director, I still felt like that I was in "trial &amp; error" mode throughout my entire first year. I was one of those first year school librarians that wanted to do everything perfectly, which is not possible for anybody. After a rejunvenating and restful summer, I now enter my second year term more relaxed and more self-confident in the unique abilities, knowledge, and experiences I bring to my school.



Professional Aspirations:

Because of all the stress I experienced during my first year as Director, I would like to start a support network for information professionals who are starting their 1st year as the library director/head librarian for their school library.</td>

              <td>My career spans public and school libraries. The Rutgers MLIS program was instrumental in helping me define and shape my view of how libraries should serve individuals and communities. As a Children’s Librarian, I worked with toddlers to teens in a small central NJ town. My library career began by serving special education students and this theme has continued throughout my career. As a media specialist, I strive to create 21st Century Library Media Centers which include all students, especially those with special needs. I have redesigned spaces to allow for shared, active engagement, expanding the use of digital resources, and incorporating a strong student volunteer component.

As a school leader, I developed inquiry-based programs which resulted in a 100% graduation and 100% college acceptance rate for a school with a 90% eligibility for free and reduced lunch and 50% eligibility for special education services. I also work as a private consultant, evaluating media centers and providing reading and writing interventions for students.</td>

Most exciting about the initiative is the focus on the value of libraries not only to patrons but to one another.

Universal library themes can revolve around our acceptance of all with a deep commitment to intellectual freedom. More than ever, we need to create a platform where libraries can collaborate to advocate for each other. This past year all the media specialists in my district nominated our supervisor for an award because we feel valued by what we do. I would be honored to participate in ALA’s initiative to engage our library community as we “showcase our magnificent work”.</td>

While the Executive Director could certainly hold additional credentials in addition to the MLIS degree, I do not wish to see this requirement change. I cannot imagine other professional associations, such as the American Medical Assocation or the American Bar Association having an Executive Director without credentials in the field he/she was leading.

My second concern is the ability to change a large national organization so that younger members feel that they have something to contribute and that the organization has something to give back to them in return. This will only happen if ALA is willing to "shake up" the status quo, such as foregoing Midwinter.</td>

I believe my previous council experience ( MI chapter councilor 2004-2006) as well as my more recent experience on the Committee on Legislation (2015-2019) prepare me to serve the membership through election to Council.  ALA is undergoing a crucial and necessary re-alignment of structure, purpose, and governance.  During this time it is important that Council actively work to engage the membership on all levels.  Realigning ALA's tradiitional relationships wiith members, divisions, chapters and staff is an important part of any successful change.  Additionally, Council must speak for the profession, which, while sometimes difficult, is a fundamental responsibility.  I would be honored to part of such debates.</td>

We are experiencing dynamic change for libraries, and ALA is a leader in embracing, supporting, and advocating progressive change. One thing I can attest to is that I am adept at learning other cultures and perspectives, respecting differences, communicating clearly and finding common ground on which to base a resolution. This skill is often relied upon in my daily work-life as a library administrator. I feel that this is a core component of being part of a team, a team which will represent you.

              <td>As a district level coordinator, in collaboration with K-12 school librarians, I was able to develop and implement a checklist used by our school librarians in a peer review program. The activity provided opportunities for K-12 school librarians to observe their peers during an instructional activity involving students. Feedback provided evidence that peer-to-peer interactions/observations improve and promote quality teaching and learning in school library programs when student achievement is a priority. ‘Glow and grow’ comments were prepared and shared during group discussions with the school librarian hosting the visit. Written comments were given to the school librarian for his/her use. This activity was successful for the peer reviewers, school librarian, and district coordinator. Reviewers were able to see ‘best practice’ in action. In addition, peer reviewers were able to see practices which added little to no value to curricula, quality instruction, or student engagement/achievement. In a thirty minute visit, practitioners were able to visualize and internalize, through observation and discussion, a quality school library activity. The learning experience was priceless.</td>

At the district level, I had opportunities to interview, hire, and observe recent graduates from many graduate programs. The quality of the practicum experience for these candidates varied by program type and location: face-to-face, online, or hybrid. It was evident that some of the new school librarians would require additional professional development and long term support from the school district. To ensure that these employees could survive the district motto, ‘hire to retire,’ school district funds would be used to remediate graduates from costly graduate programs. P-12 students, school districts, and tax payers deserve a better product (i.e., quality teachers and school librarians) for classrooms and school libraries. My investigations continue.</td>

I’m particularly proud to have recently collaborated on drafting and successfully passing the Resolution on Gender Inclusive Bathrooms at ALA Conferences and Meetings, and look forward to working with ALA to make sure accessible bathrooms to all members are always available in future.


I’m also currently part of a small group of Councilors working on an assessment of Council forum times to determine when Council Fora are held in the coming Midwinter Meetings and Annual Conferences.

I’ve spent the majority of my first term on Council learning and absorbing our various processes in order to make Council a little less opaque to newer ALA members, such as current Spectrum Scholars, Emerging Leaders, and first-time conference attendees. I’ve listened to and discussed issues with fellow Councilors and knowledgeable members of ALA, and this past year began collaborating on resolutions.

I would love the opportunity to do more and humbly ask for your vote.</td>

I will continue to discuss, collaborate on, and pass resolutions and amend existing procedure to continue making ALA an ever more inclusive, thoughtful, and progressive organization that walks the walk when talking about equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Now I feel more knowledgeable in how Council works and the purpose of its various committees, I hope to volunteer for at least one of these and gain more valuable experience while taking a more active role.

These have been rewarding years as a group of talented individuals has come together to revise training materials, make them available via a revamped website, develop an online video training course, online office hours, and an orientation session for new Councilors.

We have developed training for ourselves and future committee members and have restarted regular reporting to ALA Council and membership and written about the resolutions process for Cognotes and the American Libraries blog.

Considering these successes, I have asked ALA President-Elect Wanda Brown to appoint a long-standing member of the Committee as new Chair.

The reality is “nobody”.  As a Councilor at-large, I intend to engage with members in-person and online.

I will: share my opinions on issues facing ALA, advocate at Council to represent the membership who elected me. To me, ALA’s values are paramount: intellectual freedom, diversity, lifelong learning, advocacy, devotion to the public good.

We are in a state of transition, and we will make decisions that affect us as ALA evolves into a new structure. These tough decisions must be led by our strategic directions: advocacy, information policy, professional leadership, and equity, diversity, and inclusion. We must continue to grow, increase our membership, become more responsive to a changing membership, increase our field's diversity, and much more.

I bring a wealth of ALA leadership, commitment, vision, experience and knowledge to Council.  I look forward to our agenda for the future.  Vote Symons!</td>

Through a variety of social networks, I’ve led educators and librarians around the world in exploring the powerful roles new digital tools could play in practice and in continual professional growth.

Because my library experiences have been varied—as a special, public and school librarian--I’ve had a lens across libraryland. Should I be elected, I’d like to explore innovative possibilities to bridge our profession, as well as our communities. This is the moment for librarians to lead. In a divisive and chaotic information landscape, we need to ensure that all practitioners—members and non-members--are connected and retooled, able to lead sustainable literacy efforts on traditional and emerging platforms. To engage and improve communities, we need to be able to see the ceiling, rather than the floor of our practice.</td>

              <td>I’ve been a librarian and member of the ALA since the mid-1980s, joining just as I was finishing MLS.  The ALA gave me a place to continue to feed myself over the years while I focused on working as a solo, first in a library for engineers (1987-2013) and then in medicine (2013 to September 30, 2018).  I’ve appreciated being a solo because I have learned a lot – mostly about myself but also about serving patrons nontraditionally and corporation-ally. Having the ALA available to me from afar, providing community and insights from professionals, was inestimable.  This is what I want to ensure and provide for librarians of the future – an avenue to the intelligence, grounding, and acumen of others in the profession that will inspire and invigorate both what they do individually and also institutionally.</td>
